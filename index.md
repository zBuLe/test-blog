# Welcome to My Site

This site uses the **BlueStar-Theme** — a clean, minimal Jekyll theme. test

Here’s where you can add your welcome message, personal intro, or project highlights.

## Getting Started

- Edit this `index.md` file to update your homepage.
- Add posts under the `_posts` folder (if you want a blog).
- Customize your `_config.yml` for site settings.
- Update your navigation by editing `_includes/header.html`.

Happy building!
